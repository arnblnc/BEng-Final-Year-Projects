# Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Lab Report
## Description
This folder houses files and a detailed lab report for a comprehensive study on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), with a focus on understanding and simulating heat transfer in a rectangular chamber both with and without ribs. The project showcases a profound grasp of CFD principles, numerical simulations, and technical communication. It serves as a testament to analytical thinking, problem-solving, and practical application in fluid dynamics simulations and analysis.

## Highlights
- Heat Transfer Study in a Rectangular Chamber: Employed the ANSYS Fluent software to simulate the effects of ribs on heat transfer in a rectangular chamber. This study delves into various parameters such as the Nusselt number, heat flux, and total heat transfer rate. The repository contains contour plots for TKE (turbulent kinetic energy) and temperature, along with a vector plot for velocity, illuminating the intricate details of the simulation and its findings.
- CFD Assignment Brief: This repository also includes the assignment brief for the CFD course, detailing the expectations and guidelines for the project.

## Files
