# AI Handwriting Recognition Report
## Description
This folder contains files and a comprehensive report centered around the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for handwriting recognition. The projects within demonstrate an enhanced understanding of AI principles, techniques, and practical implementations. It stands as a testament to rigorous research, problem-solving, and the application of AI in solving real-world challenges.

## Highlights
- AI Handwriting Recognition: A detailed exploration into the complexities of recognising different styles of handwriting, specifically distinguishing between constrained and unconstrained handwriting. The goal is to create a program that can efficiently recognise the more common unconstrained handwriting, ensuring wider applicability.
- Report Structure: Provides a structured guide for the AI project, detailing various sections like introduction, design, results, and conclusions. It offers a roadmap for the systematic presentation of the project's findings.
- Group Project Brief: An assignment proforma that outlines the expectations, guidelines, and structure for the "Introduction to AI Applications in Engineering" project.

## Files
- Report Structure.pdf: A structured guide detailing the breakdown of the AI group project.
- ME3624 Group Project 2021-22 Brief.pdf: Official assignment/coursework proforma for the AI project.
- AI Final Report.pdf: Comprehensive report detailing the methodologies, findings, and analyses related to AI and handwriting recognition.
- Constrained and unconstrained handwriting.docx: In-depth analysis of the challenges and intricacies of recognizing different handwriting styles, with a focus on constrained vs. unconstrained handwriting.
